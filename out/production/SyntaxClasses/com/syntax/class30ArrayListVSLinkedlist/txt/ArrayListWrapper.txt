********************** Wrapper classes ******************

Object types for all primitive types. When we use the wrapper classes we get all the benefits
of classes and objects for example we can have built-in methods. Generics work with classes only

Boxing in wrapper class -- converting primitive to corresponding wrapper type
    int num=10;
    Integer num2=new Integer(num);

Unboxing -- converting wrapper object to corresponding primitive type
    Integer num2=new Integer(10);
    int num=num2.intValue();

Autoboxing
    Integer num=10;

AutoUnboxing
    int num2=num;

List (it is an interface in collection frame which is implemented by two classes ArrayList and LinkedList)
    1) we can store the duplicate values in lists
    2) insertion order is maintained

When to use ArrayList?
    If most of the operations are reading and storing new date but nor shifting or changing the position of data
    then we should use ArrayList.

When to use LinkedList?
    When most of the operations are related to changing the position of data or related to data shifting
    then we should go with LinkedList
