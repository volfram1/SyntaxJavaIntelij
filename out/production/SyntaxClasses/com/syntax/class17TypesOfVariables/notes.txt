************** Types of VARIABLES ******************
-local - inside method, loop, if etc.
-instance - outside the method or any other block of code but inside of class. Are called fields.
-static - same as instance variable, and it has static keyword with it

************** example *************
Class Vars{
int age=10; //instance variable
static double weight=25.5; // static variable

void method(){
String name="Moreed"; //local variable
}
}

*********** When to use variables **************

-- Local variables -- should be always preferred over instance and static variables
because they occupy the memory for short period of time. As soon as the purpose is served Java destroys them.
    +pros - save memory
     cons - not accessible outside of methods

-- instance variables -- when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information
is expected to be different form object to object
    +pros - accessible all over the code
    -cons - occupy the memory longer than local

-- static variables -- when we know that the information will stay the same for all objects of the class.
                        accessible by class name
    +pros - single memory location for all objects of the class
    -cons - stay longer in the memory,
            can hold only one value at a time

*************** Homework ***************

Create a Class called Students
Create three  variables  Name , ID  and  numberOfStudents
Create three objects of the Students Class
Set the value for  studentName , studentID and increment  the numberOfStudents for each object
Print out  total number of students
