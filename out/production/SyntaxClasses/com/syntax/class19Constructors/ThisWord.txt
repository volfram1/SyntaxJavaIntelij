--------------------- "THIS" keyword -------------------------

it is a reserved keyword in java that we use to refer to instance variables methods or constructors of a class

1) this keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
2) we can use "this" keyword to call the constructor of a class inside another constructor
3) we can use the "this" keyword to call the methods of a class

Rules:
1) this() should be the first line inside the constructor
2) this() can't be used inside methods
