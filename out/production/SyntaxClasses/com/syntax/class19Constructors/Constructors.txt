**************************** CONSTRUCTORS ************************

Constructor allows us to set the values of the fields of a class.
Constructors in java are special blocks of code similar to methods that initialize objects of a class.


Purpose of the constructor is to gve initial values to the fields of the class.
Good practice is to make the fields(instance variables) private.

Rules:
1) don't have a return type not even void
2) name of the constructor must be the same as name of the class
3) Constructors can't have non access modifiers like static, final etc.
4) we can use the access modifiers like public private protected with constructors
5) if we don't write a constructor in a class a default constructor is provided by compiler
6) we can have multiple constructors in a class but their number of arguments sequence of argument or
type of arguments should be different
7) if we have multiple constructors then java decide which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass
