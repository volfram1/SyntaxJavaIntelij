************************* Method Overloading ***********************

When the same method name exists in a class but with different number of parameters or different data types of
parameters or different sequence of parameters.

Advantages:
    1) flexibility of having same name methods in class
    2) end user gets the benefit that he doesn't need to remember different method names

Rules:
    1) we overload the constructor
    2) we can overload the static method as well
    3) we can overload the main method as well

Rules for static methods:
    1) static methods cannot access instance fields directly
    2) instance methods can access instance and static fields directly
