******************** Interface vs Abstract Class *******************

Abstraction in Java -- hiding implementation details and providing the functionality

Two methods to achieve abstraction
    1) Abstract classes -- classes with abstract keyword
    2) interfaces -- contracts created with help of interface keyword

How to decide which one to use:
    1) prefer the interfaces over abstract classes
    2) if two or more classes are closely related to each other go with abstract classes for example
        -- if we have to create a Lion class and horse class we have to go with abstract classes and should create
        an animal abstract class.
        -- if two classes are not related to each other for example an Apple and cloth we should create an interface
        for that like if we want to have a behaviour washable

Encapsulation:
 it is the fourth pillar of OOPS. it provides security and better control over data of a class.
 we create a classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods. These methods are
 classes getter setter methods, and we set and get the values of the class fields with the help of these methods instead
 of accessing and modifying them directly.
