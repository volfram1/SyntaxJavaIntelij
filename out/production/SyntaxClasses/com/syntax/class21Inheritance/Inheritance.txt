Inheritance - is a mechanism in Java through which a child class gets the properties methods from a parent class.

child class - subclass - derived
parent class - superclass - baseclass

Benefits:
    1) Saves time to code
    2) code duplication is reduced
    3) execution time is faster

Disadvantages:
    1) classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class

Types of inheritance:
    There are 4 types of inheritance but Java only supports 3 of them.
    1) single - only one child and one parent class. Or only 2 classes participate in inheritance.

            class Parent{
            }
            class Child extends Parent{
            }

    2) Hierarchical - single parent class and multiple child classes

            class Parent{
            }
            class Child extends Parent{
            }
            class Child extends Parent{
                        }


    3) Multilevel - multiple levels of inheritance for example if we have a classes A B C
                    class C will be inherited from class B and class B from class A

                    class A{
                    }
                    class B extend A{
                    }
                    class A extend B{
                    }


    4) Multiple (not supported in Java)
