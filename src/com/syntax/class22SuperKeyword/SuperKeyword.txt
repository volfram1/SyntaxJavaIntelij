------------------ SUPER keyword ----------------
is like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object.

We can use the super keyword in 3 different ways.
    1) to access the super class variables if we have same named variables in super class and base class
    2) if we have the same method names in parent class and child class
        we can use the super keyword to access parent class method
        otherwise by default java revers to the child class method
    3) as constructors don't participate in inheritance we can use super() to call the constructors from the
        parent class

Rules:
1. if we have a constructor in the parent class that takes two arguments we must have a constructor inside the child class
    that at least takes those two arguments
2. we can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor
3. super can't be used in static methods
