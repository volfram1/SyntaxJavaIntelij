OOPS Main Pillars:
    1) Inheritance (code re-usability)
    2) Polymorphism (less code, dynamic code)
    3) Abstraction (
    4) Encapsulation



Rules:

Abstract classes can have all things that regular classes do, but we can't create their objects
directly and if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must either provide the implementation for the...


Abstract classes in Java:
Abstract classes in java are the classes with abstract keyword. We use that keyword to achieve abstraction.

Abstraction:
    In the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality to end user

Benefits:
1) reduces the complexity.
2) improves the maintainability
3) Can also enforce rules up to certain limit.

Disadvantages:
1) classes get tightly coupled
