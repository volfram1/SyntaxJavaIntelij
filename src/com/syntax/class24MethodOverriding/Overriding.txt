************************** Method overriding ******************************

-- When we have the same name methods in the Parent class and in the child class.
-- we can only override a method if we have inheritance relationship between two classes
-- we can't override the private methods because they don't participate in inheritance
-- we can't override the constructors because they don't participate in inheritance
